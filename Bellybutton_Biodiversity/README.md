# Bellybutton_Biodiversity

This is a class project shared in hopes that it was a close analog to  what is probably my most impressive project which couldn't be shown directly due to sensitive contents.  Of that mark, it falls very short.

The real teeth to that project was combining, synthesizing and analyzing data from disperate sources, never intended to be used for anything remotely similar for my purposes, something which was could not be duplicated or imitated.  and serving those analyses to an HTML page, viewable by anyone without special software or in any form that would require its deployment to a webserver, something entirely unnecssary for a page deployed on GitHub pages, so it really only shows off front-end data visualization skills.

Superficially it looks somewhat similar and the graphs look neat, so I stuck with it. The deployed project can be viewed [here](https://psychicesp.github.io/Bellybutton_Biodiversity/Bellybutton_Page.html)
