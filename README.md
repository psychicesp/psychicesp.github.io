# Digital Resume



This is my digital resume, to be viewed: [here](index.html)  

The landing page should be a slightly-more-detailed version of my paper Resume displayed in a mobile-friendly format.  On the top are links to my Github, my LinkedIn and highlighted projects.  The landing page for each of these projects should be self-sufficient to give you context for what is there, and what it is trying to show.
