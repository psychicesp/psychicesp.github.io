# Movie Data Analysis

This project started out as a way to show off a project done for work, substituting dummy data pulled from IMDb and OMDb instead of the sensitive data in the original.
 

As I progressed I found that, not only was the movie data did not support similar analyses, but also that I also had my own questions and testible predictions about the Movie dataset, and this veered off-course from there.

The program which pulled the data from the API is in movie_df_puller.ipynb and the visualizations and statistical analyses are in ESPgraphs.ipynb and the deployed project can be viewed [here](https://psychicesp.github.io/Movie_Project/Movie_Data.html)
