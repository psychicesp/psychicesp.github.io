                    <h1>The Analysis of Movie Data</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Why movie data?</h3>
                    <p class='prose'>Movie data can be some of the best data to play around with
                        ironically
                        because, by rights, it should be some of the worst to work with.
                        There is no objective way to determine whether or not a movie is 'good.' People who make movies
                        prefer them to make a lot of money, but many agree than some of
                        these high-grossing money-grabs aren't good movies and one of the better ways to make money in
                        the long run and secure a stable career is to produce a movie that is,
                        well, <em>good</em>. If one tries to use a metric other than money-made to determing how 'good'
                        a movie
                        is, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to use as a response variable.
                        If one does decide to use money-made as a response variable for the success of a movie, that has
                        its own issues. A 2000 dollar is worth more than a 2020 dollar, yet a movie
                        released in 2000 has had more time to make money than one in 2000.</p>
                    <p class='prose'>Beyond deciding on a response variable, there are many many factors which determine
                        a movies outcome. A large mass of discrete, continuous and catergorical variables determines a
                        movies success. Some are easy to find and can be pulled from the same sources at the movie data
                        itself but many are hidden and hard to isolate, such as the historical context and which other
                        movies were out at the same time. In addition the intangible factor of how 'good' it actually is
                        might have the largest effect. While it is the very Holy Grail we are questing for, we know from
                        the beginning it is a fruitless quest and this invisible and immeasureable variable can turn out to
                        be our biggest confounder.
                    </p>
                    <p class="prose">The saving grace of movie data would be how plentiful it is. No matter how noisy or
                        incomplete the data is there is just so darn much of it that you can mine statistical
                        significance when you find a variable with a real effect. This is what makes it so great for
                        honing Data Analysis skills. A fumbling analysis can find a neat relationship yet there is always
                        more work to be done to find something more interesting.</p>
                    <h3>My Analysis</h3>
                    <p class='prose'> The data was leftover from a group project. Building on the exploratory analysis
                        done as a group and being now familiar with the data made for a great opportunity to make some
                        actual predictions to do some bona fide hypothesis testing.
                    </p>
                    <p class='prose'>
                        The 'Box_Office' seemed a great response variable as it seemed closest to what a production
                        company would consider a success, but in addition to the confounding variables mentioned above,
                        the actual reporting of Box Office take seemed surprisingly sparse, with almost all 'null'
                        values pre-2000.
                    </p>
                    <p class="prose"> A quick correlation matrix of all proposed response variables revealed IMDb Rating to be
                        a pretty consitently good predictor of success by the other metrics. It also was almost never
                        null which made it a great alternative to Box Office when that data was sparse.</p>
                        <p class = "prose"> For these reasons the response variables of choice were 'Box Office' and 'IMDb Rating'</p>
